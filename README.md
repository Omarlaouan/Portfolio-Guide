# Machine Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Algorithms |Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü™¢ [Citation Prediction](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/citation_prediciton) | Python, Jypyter Notebook| Graph Neural Network | The goal of this project is to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to the link prediction problem of whether a research paper cites another research paper. The citation network consists of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their lists of authors. The dataset was taken from machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, and natural language processing conferences and journals. The project aims to use edge information to learn the parameters of a classifier and then to use the classifier to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not. [Here is the detailed presentation of the project](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/citation_prediciton/blob/main/Project%20presentation%20-%20citation%20prediction.pdf) |
| üí∞ [Credit Default Prediction](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/credit_default_prediction) | Python, Jypyter Notebook | Decision trees algorithms | In this machine learning project I aim to predict whether a customer will default on a loan within 60 days of disbursement. The project uses historical customer financial data to train and evaluate several machine learning models and select the best-performing one for deployment. I created a streamit app that you can interact with.

# MLOps

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üöó [Uber Taxi](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Uber%20Project) | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Dog%20Adoption) | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
