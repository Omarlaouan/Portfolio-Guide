# Machine Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Algorithms |Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ðŸ’° [Credit Default Prediction](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/credit_default_prediction) | Python, Jypyter Notebook | Decision Trees Algorithms | In this machine learning project I aim to predict whether a customer will default on a loan within 60 days of disbursement. The project uses historical customer financial data to train and evaluate several machine learning models and select the best-performing one for deployment. [Here is the detailed presentation of the project](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/credit_default_prediction/blob/main/Project%20presentation.pdf) |

# Deep Learning

| Project Link | Tools | Algorithms |Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ðŸ“„ [Citation Link Prediction](https://github.com/Omarlaouan/citation_prediciton) | Python, Jypyter Notebook| Graph Neural Network | The goal of this project is to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to the link prediction problem of whether a research paper cites another research paper. The citation network consists of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their lists of authors. The dataset was taken from machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, and natural language processing conferences and journals. The project aims to use edge information to learn the parameters of a classifier and then to use the classifier to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not.
